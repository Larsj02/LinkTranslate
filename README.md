# LinkTranslate

**LinkTranslate** is a World of Warcraft addon that automatically translates all chat hyperlinks into your client language, enabling seamless cross-region communication and understanding.

## Features

- **Automatic Hyperlink Translation:**  
  All hyperlinks (items, achievements, quests, spells, mounts, etc.) in chat are instantly translated into your client’s language. No need to hover or click to see what a link means!

- **Supports All Major Link Types:**  
  Translates nearly every kind of WoW chat link, including:
  - Items, Achievements, Spells, Quests
  - Dungeons, Mounts, Battle Pets
  - Community, Player, Guild, Calendar events
  - Transmog, Currency, Talents, and more

- **Asynchronous and Seamless:**  
  Works asynchronously, so translations happen in the background without causing chat lag or interruptions.

- **Multi-Region and Multi-Language:**  
  Especially useful for players on foreign realms or in international guilds, where links may appear in a different language or region format.

- **No User Interaction Needed:**  
  Translations are automatic—just read chat as normal and see all links in your language.

- **Extensible and Future-Proof:**  
  Designed with a modular structure, making it easy to support new link types as World of Warcraft evolves.

## Why use LinkTranslate?

- Effortless understanding of all chat links, regardless of server language or region
- Stay connected with friends and guildmates from around the world
- Avoid confusion and miscommunication in cross-realm or international communities

## How does it work?

LinkTranslate intercepts chat messages, parses all supported hyperlinks, and rewrites them with the translated information according to your WoW client’s language settings, all in real time.
